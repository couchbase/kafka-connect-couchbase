= Source Configuration Options

Reference of the source connector options.

== Database

=== `connection.cluster_address`

Couchbase Cluster addresses to listen (use comma to specify several).

* Type: list
* Importance: high

=== `connection.bucket`

Couchbase bucket name.

* Type: string
* Importance: high

=== `connection.username`

Couchbase username for Couchbase Server 5.0 and later.

* Type: string
* Importance: high
* Default: the bucket name specified by `connection.bucket`

=== `connection.password`

Couchbase password. For Couchbase Server versions prior to 5.0 this is
the bucket password. For versions 5.0 and later, this is the password
associated with `connection.username`.

* Type: password
* Importance: low
* Default: `""`

=== `connection.timeout.ms`

Connection timeout in milliseconds.

* Type: long
* Importance: low

=== `connection.ssl.enabled`

Use SSL to connect to Couchbase. This feature only available in
Couchbase Enterprise.

* Type: boolean
* Importance: low
* Default: `false`
* Dependents: `connection.ssl.keystore.location`,
`connection.ssl.keystore.password`

=== `connection.ssl.keystore.location`

The location of the key store file.

* Type: string
* Importance: low

=== `connection.ssl.keystore.password`

The password of the private key in the key store file.

* Type: password
* Importance: low
* Default: `""`

== Connector

=== `topic.name`

Name of the Kafka topic to publish data to.

* Type: string
* Importance: high

=== `use_snapshots`

If true, it will only commit into Kafka when full snapshot from
Couchbase received.

* Type: boolean
* Importance: low
* Default: `false`

=== `dcp.message.converter.class`

The class name of the message converter to use.

* Type: string
* Importance: low
* Default:
`"com.couchbase.connect.kafka.handler.source.DefaultSchemaSourceHandler"`

=== `event.filter.class`

The class name of the event filter to use.

* Type: string
* Importance: low
* Default: `"com.couchbase.connect.kafka.filter.AllPassFilter"`

=== `couchbase.stream_from`

The point in Couchbase history to start streaming from.

* Possible values:
** SAVED_OFFSET_OR_BEGINNING - Restart from saved state, or if none,
restart from oldest available mutation in Couchbase
** SAVED_OFFSET_OR_NOW - Restart from saved state, or if none, restart
from current Couchbase state
** BEGINNING - Restart from oldest available mutation in Couchbase
(ignore any potential saved state)
** NOW - Restart from current Couchbase state (ignore any potential saved
state)

* Since: 3.2.2
* Type: string
* Importance: low
* Default: `"SAVED_OFFSET_OR_BEGINNING"`

=== `couchbase.log_redaction`

Optionally tag sensitive values in the log output for later redaction.

* Possible values:
** NONE - No redaction is performed.
** PARTIAL - Only user data is redacted, system and metadata are not.
** FULL - User, System and Metadata are all redacted.

* Since: 3.2.3
* Type: string
* Importance: low
* Default: `"NONE"`

=== `couchbase.compression`

To reduce bandwidth usage, Couchbase Server 5.5 and later can send
documents to the connector in compressed form. (Messages are always
published to the Kafka topic in uncompressed form, regardless of this
setting.) If the requested mode is not supported by your version of
Couchbase Server, compression will be disabled.

* Possible values:
** `ENABLED` - (default) Couchbase Server decides whether to use compression
on a per-document basis, depending on whether the compressed form of the
document is readily available. Select this mode to prioritize Couchbase Server
performance and reduced bandwidth usage (recommended). *Requires Couchbase Server 5.5 or later*.
** `DISABLED` - No compression. Select this mode to prioritize reduced CPU load
for the Kafka connector.
** `FORCED` - Compression is used for every document, unless compressed
size is greater than uncompressed size. Select this mode to prioritize bandwidth
usage reduction above all else. *Requires Couchbase Server 5.5 or later*.

* Since: 3.3.0
* Type: string
* Importance: low
* Default: `"ENABLED"`

=== `couchbase.forceIPv4`

In a network environment that supports both IPv4 and IPv6, setting this property
to `true` will force the use of IPv4 when resolving Couchbase Server hostnames.

* Since: 3.3.0
* Type: boolean
* Importance: low
* Default: `false`

=== `couchbase.persistence_polling_interval`

The frequency at which the connector will poll Couchbase Server to determine
which database changes are unlikely to be rolled back. A value of `0`
disables polling and causes changes to be published to the Kafka topic as soon as they are received.

NOTE: If polling is disabled, when rollbacks occur you are more likely to end up with events
in the Kafka topic that do not match the actual database state, because
they are from an "alternate timeline" in Couchbase Server's history.

The longer the polling interval, the larger the flow control buffer required
in order to maintain steady throughput, since events are buffered
until persistence is confirmed.

If present, the value must be `0` or an integer followed by a time unit:
(`ms` = milliseconds, `s` = seconds)

* Since: 3.4.0-beta.1 (*Uncommitted*; API may change in a patch release)
* Type: string
* Importance: low
* Default: `"100ms"`

=== `couchbase.flow_control_buffer`

The amount of heap space to reserve for the flow control buffer.
This is the amount of data Couchbase Server will push to the connector
before awaiting acknowledgement that the data has been published to the Kafka topic.

If present, the value must be an integer followed by a storage size unit:
(`b` = bytes, `k` = kilobytes, `m` = megabytes, `g` = gigabytes)

NOTE: This value must be smaller than the connect worker's heap size.
To allocate more memory to the connect worker process,
set the `KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS` environment variable before starting the worker.
For example: `export KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS=-Xmx1024M`

* Since: 3.4.0-beta.1 (*Uncommitted*; API may change in a patch release)
* Type: string
* Importance: low
* Default: `"128m"`
