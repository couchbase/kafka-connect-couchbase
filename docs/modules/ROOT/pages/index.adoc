= Introduction

[abstract]
The Kafka connector provides functionality to stream, filter, and transform events between Couchbase Server and Kafka.

The Couchbase sink connector allows you to import data from https://kafka.apache.org[Kafka^] topics into Couchbase Server.

The Couchbase source connector allows you to export data from Couchbase Server to Kafka topics.

Data is loaded efficiently and reliably using Couchbase's internal replication protocol, DCP.
Every change to or deletion of the document generates a replication event, which is then sent to the configured Kafka topic.
When copying data from a bucket, the connector loads only new or modified documents.

== Compatibility

Because the Kafka connector relies heavily on DCP, it is only compatible with Couchbase Server 3.0 and later.

== Contributing

Couchbase welcomes community contributions to the Kafka connector.
The https://github.com/couchbase/kafka-connect-couchbase[Kafka Connector source code^] is available on GitHub.
