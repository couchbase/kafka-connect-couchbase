== Connection

[[couchbase.seed.nodes]]
=== `couchbase.seed.nodes`

Addresses of Couchbase Server nodes, delimited by commas.

If a custom port is specified, it must be the KV port (which is normally 11210 for insecure connections, or 11207 for secure connections).

* Type: list
* Importance: high

[[couchbase.username]]
=== `couchbase.username`

Name of the Couchbase user to authenticate as.

* Type: string
* Importance: high

[[couchbase.password]]
=== `couchbase.password`

Password of the Couchbase user.

May be overridden with the KAFKA_COUCHBASE_PASSWORD environment variable.

* Type: password

* Importance: high

[[couchbase.network]]
=== `couchbase.network`

The network selection strategy for connecting to a Couchbase Server cluster that advertises alternate addresses.

A Couchbase node running inside a container environment (like Docker or Kubernetes) might be configured to advertise both its address within the container environment (known as its "default" address) as well as an "external" address for use by clients connecting from outside the environment.

Setting the 'couchbase.network' config property to 'default' or 'external' forces the selection of the respective addresses.
Setting the value to 'auto' tells the connector to select whichever network contains the addresses specified in the 'couchbase.seed.nodes' config property.

* Type: string
* Default: `auto`
* Importance: medium

[[couchbase.bootstrap.timeout]]

On startup, the connector will wait this long for a Couchbase connection to be established.
If a connection is not established before the timeout expires, the connector will terminate.

* Type: string
* Default: `30s`
* Valid Values: An integer followed by a time unit (ms = milliseconds, s = seconds, m = minutes, h = hours, d = days). For example, to specify 30 minutes: 30m
* Importance: medium

== Security

[[couchbase.enable.tls]]
=== `couchbase.enable.tls`

Use secure connection to Couchbase Server.

If true, you must also tell the connector which certificate to trust.
Specify a certificate file with 'couchbase.trust.certificate.path', or a Java keystore file with 'couchbase.trust.store.path' and 'couchbase.trust.store.password'.

[[couchbase.enable.hostname.verification]]
=== `couchbase.enable.hostname.verification`

Set this to `false` to disable TLS hostname verification for Couchbase connections.
Less secure, but might be required if for some reason you can't issue a certificate whose Subject Alternative Names match the hostname used to connect to the server.
Only disable if you understand the impact and can accept the risks.

* Type: boolean
* Default: `true`
* Importance: medium

[[couchbase.trust.store.path]]
=== `couchbase.trust.store.path`

* Default: `""`
* Importance: medium

[[couchbase.client.certificate.password]]
=== `couchbase.client.certificate.password`

Password for accessing the client certificate.

May be overridden with the KAFKA_COUCHBASE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD environment variable.

[[couchbase.default.collection]]
=== `couchbase.default.collection`

Qualified name (scope.collection or bucket.scope.collection) of the destination collection for messages from topics that don't have an entry in the `couchbase.topic.to.collection` map.

If the bucket component contains a dot, escape it by enclosing it in backticks.

If the bucket component is omitted, it defaults to the value of the `couchbase.bucket` property.

* Type: string
* Default: `_default._default`
* Valid Values: A qualified collection name like 'scope.collection' or 'bucket.scope.collection'. If the bucket component contains a dot, escape it by enclosing it in backticks.
* Importance: medium

[[couchbase.topic.to.collection]]
=== `couchbase.topic.to.collection`

A map from Kafka topic to Couchbase collection.

Topic and collection are joined by an equals sign.
Map entries are delimited by commas.

A collection name is of the form `bucket.scope.collection` or `scope.collection`.
If the bucket component is omitted, it defaults to the value of the `couchbase.bucket` property.
If the bucket component contains a dot, escape it by enclosing it in backticks.

For example, if you want to write messages from topic "topic1" to collection "scope-a.invoices" in the default bucket, and messages from topic "topic2" to collection "scope-a.widgets" in bucket "other-bucket" you would write: "topic1=scope-a.invoices,topic2=other-bucket.scope-a.widgets".

Defaults to an empty map, with all documents going to the collection specified by `couchbase.default.collection`.

* Type: list
* Default: `""`
* Valid Values: topic1=scope.collection,topic2=other-bucket.scope.collection,... If a bucket component contains a dot, escape it by enclosing it in backticks.
* Importance: medium

[[couchbase.topic.to.document.id]]
=== `couchbase.topic.to.document.id`

A map of per-topic overrides for the `couchbase.document.id` configuration property.

Topic and document ID format are joined by an equals sign.
Map entries are delimited by commas.

For example, if documents from topic "topic1" should be assigned document IDs that match their "id" field, and documents from topic "topic2" should be assigned documents IDs that match their "identifier" field, you would write: "topic1=${/id},topic2=${/identifier}".

Defaults to an empty map, which means the value of the `couchbase.document.id` configuration property is applied to documents from all topics.

UNCOMMITTED; this feature may change in a patch release without notice.

* Since: 4.2.4

* Type: list
* Default: `""`
* Valid Values: topic1=${/id},topic2=${/some/other/path},...

[[couchbase.sink.handler]]
=== `couchbase.sink.handler`

The fully-qualified class name of the sink handler to use.
The sink handler determines how the Kafka record is translated into actions on Couchbase documents.

The built-in handlers are: `com.couchbase.connect.kafka.handler.sink.UpsertSinkHandler`, `com.couchbase.connect.kafka.handler.sink.N1qlSinkHandler`, and `com.couchbase.connect.kafka.handler.sink.SubDocumentSinkHandler`.

You can customize the sink connector's behavior by implementing your own SinkHandler.

* Type: class
* Default: `com.couchbase.connect.kafka.handler.sink.UpsertSinkHandler`
* Importance: medium

[[couchbase.document.mode]]
=== `couchbase.document.mode`

Overrides the `couchbase.sink.handler` property.

A value of `N1QL` forces the handler to `com.couchbase.connect.kafka.handler.sink.N1qlSinkHandler`.
A value of `SUBDOCUMENT` forces the handler to `com.couchbase.connect.kafka.handler.sink.SubDocumentSinkHandler`.

WARNING: *DEPRECATED.* Please set the `couchbase.sink.handler` property instead.

* Type: string
* Default: `DOCUMENT`
* Valid Values: One of [DOCUMENT, SUBDOCUMENT, N1QL]
* Importance: medium

[[couchbase.document.id]]
=== `couchbase.document.id`

* Importance: medium

[[couchbase.document.expiration]]
=== `couchbase.document.expiration`

Document expiration time specified as an integer followed by a time unit (s = seconds, m = minutes, h = hours, d = days).
For example, to have documents expire after 30 minutes, set this value to "30m".

A value of "0" (the default) means documents never expire.

* Type: string
* Default: `0`
* Valid Values: An integer followed by a time unit (ms = milliseconds, s = seconds, m = minutes, h = hours, d = days). For example, to specify 30 minutes: 30m
* Importance: medium

[[couchbase.retry.timeout]]
=== `couchbase.retry.timeout`

Retry failed writes to Couchbase until this deadline is reached.
If time runs out, the connector terminates.

A value of `0` (the default) means the connector will terminate immediately when a write fails.

NOTE: This retry timeout is distinct from the KV timeout (which you can set via `couchbase.env.*`).
The KV timeout affects an individual write attempt, while the retry timeout spans multiple attempts and makes the connector resilient to more kinds of transient failures.

TIP: Try not to confuse this with the Kafka Connect framework's built-in `errors.retry.timeout` config property, which applies only to failures occurring _before_ the framework delivers the record to the Couchbase connector.

* Since: 4.1.4

* Type: string
* Default: `0`
* Valid Values: An integer followed by a time unit (ms = milliseconds, s = seconds, m = minutes, h = hours, d = days). For example, to specify 30 minutes: 30m
* Importance: medium

== Durability

[[couchbase.durability]]
=== `couchbase.durability`

The preferred way to specify an enhanced durability requirement when using Couchbase Server 6.5 or later.

For Couchbase Server versions prior to 6.5, this is how you require the connector to verify a write is persisted to disk on a certain number of replicas before considering the write successful.

If you're using Couchbase Server 6.5 or later, we recommend using the `couchbase.durability` property instead.

* Type: string
* Default: `NONE`
* Valid Values: One of [NONE, ACTIVE, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR]
* Importance: medium

[[couchbase.replicate.to]]
=== `couchbase.replicate.to`

For Couchbase Server versions prior to 6.5, this is how you require the connector to verify a write has reached the memory of a certain number of replicas before considering the write successful.

=== `couchbase.n1ql.where.fields`

When using the UPDATE_WHERE operation, this is the list of document fields that must match the Kafka message in order for the document to be updated with the remaining message fields.
To match against a literal value instead of a message field, use a colon to delimit the document field name and the target value.
For example, "type:widget,color" matches documents whose 'type' field is 'widget' and whose 'color' field matches the 'color' field of the Kafka message.

This property is specific to `N1qlSinkHandler`.

* Type: list
* Default: `""`
