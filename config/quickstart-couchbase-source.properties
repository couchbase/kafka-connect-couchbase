# To reduce bandwidth usage, Couchbase Server 5.5 and later can send documents to the connector in compressed form.
# (Messages are always published to the Kafka topic in uncompressed form, regardless of this setting.)
# If the requested mode is not supported by your version of Couchbase Server, compression will be disabled.
#   ENABLED - (default) Couchbase Server decides whether to use compression
#             on a per-document basis, depending on whether the compressed form of the
#             document is readily available. Select this mode to prioritize Couchbase Server
#             performance and reduced bandwidth usage (recommended).
#             *Requires Couchbase Server 5.5 or later*.
#   DISABLED - No compression. Select this mode to prioritize reduced CPU load for the Kafka connector.
#   FORCED - Compression is used for every document, unless compressed size is greater than uncompressed size.
#            Select this mode to prioritize bandwidth usage reduction above all else.
#            *Requires Couchbase Server 5.5 or later*.

# In some failover scenarios, Couchbase Server may roll back (undo) database
# changes that have not yet been persisted across all replicas. By default,
# the Kafka connector will poll Couchbase Server and defer event publication
# until the change has been persisted to all replicas in the cluster,
# at which time the change is unlikely to be rolled back. This feature
# introduces some latency, and increases connector memory usage and network
# traffic, but prevents rolled-back changes from appearing in the Kafka topic.
#
# The longer the polling interval, the larger the flow control buffer required
# in order to maintain steady throughput.
#
# If instead you wish to publish events immediately, set the polling interval to `0`.
# If you do, be aware that when rollbacks occur you may end up with events
# in the Kafka topic from an "alternate timeline" in Couchbase Server's history.
