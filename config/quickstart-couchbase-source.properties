# To reduce bandwidth usage, Couchbase Server 4.5 and later can send documents to the connector in compressed form.
# (Messages are always published to the Kafka topic in uncompressed form, regardless of this setting.)
#   DISABLED - No compression.
#   ENABLED - Couchbase Server decides whether to use compression on a per-document basis. For Couchbase 5.5 and later,
#             the document will be sent compressed if the server already has easy access to the compressed form.
#             For older server versions, this mode is equivalent to FORCED, and may increase server CPU load.
#   FORCED - Compression is used for every document, unless compressed size is greater than uncompressed size.
