# Optionally set the Couchbase document ID from fields of the message body.
# The value is a format string with a placeholder for each field to include
# in the ID. A placeholder looks like "${/path/to/field}" where the path is
# specified as a JSON pointer. Examples:
#   couchbase.document.id=${/id}
#   couchbase.document.id=invoice::${/id}
#   couchbase.document.id=${/metadata/type}::${/id}

# Optionally remove the ID fields from the document before saving to Couchbase.

# Optionally specify Couchbase persistence requirements for a write to be
# considered successful. Default is NONE. Other values enhance durability
# but reduce performance. If the requested requirements cannot be met
# (due to Couchbase rebalance or failover, for instance) the connector will
# terminate. Possible values:
#  NONE   - Do not require any disk persistence.
#  MASTER - Require disk persistence to the master node of the document only.
#  ONE    - Require disk persistence of one node (master or replica).
#  TWO    - Require disk persistence of two nodes (master or replica).
#  THREE  - Require disk persistence of three nodes (master or replica).
#  FOUR   - Require disk persistence of four nodes (master + three replicas).

#   NONE   - Do not require any replication.

#   TWO    - Require replication to two replicas.
#   THREE  - Require replication to three replicas.

# If you're using Confluent, the Couchbase Sink Connector can also read
# messages published in the Avro format. Replace the above *.converter
# properties with the following (modifying the schema registry URL if needed):

#   key.converter.schema.registry.url=http://localhost:8081
#   value.converter=io.confluent.connect.avro.AvroConverter

# Optionally specify a time-to-live for documents written to Couchbase.
# If present, the value must be an integer followed by a time unit:
# (s = seconds, m = minutes, h = hours, d = days).
